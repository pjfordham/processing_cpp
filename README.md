<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Inspired by the need for a friendly and simple way to display graphics in C++ harking back to the halcyon days of Borland C++. The Processing
API seemed to be a good fit.

The first step was implementing enough of the API to run the Clock example. Support for other examples was added incrementally from there and
now most of them work at comparable performance to their Java versions. With C++ and Java sharing similar syntax we are actually able to run
some of the examples unmodified, albeit with a little preprocessor trickery.

### Prerequisites

Placeholder for detailed list of what you need beyond the git submodules.

### Installation


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pfordham/processing_cpp
   ```
2. Build with cmake

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After building just run any of the executables built from the examples directories.

To get a taste of what to expect see <a href="https://processing.org/examples/">visit</a>, the original framwork's examples pages. Most of these examples work identically to their Java and Javascript counterparts.
